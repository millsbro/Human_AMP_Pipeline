i. Pull this repo

ii. Pull squeakuences repo to millsbro@submit1:/scratch/millsbro/FINAL/

iii. Push changes to repo on regular basis


1: Identify top 5 putative AMP protein sequences of len>50 from Torres et al.

2: BLAST_P search for each of 5 sequences

3: Download complete protein sequences for top 100 hits to local machine

4: SCP 5x 100 sequences to millsbro@submit1:/scratch/millsbro/FINAL/AMP_seqs/<recID>

5: Save full pathway to each set in millsbro@submit1:/scratch/millsbro/FINAL/AMP_seqs/AMP_seqs_full_path.txt

6: Squeakify eaxh of 5 sets

7: Create python script to loop through each fasta:
  a. MAFFT
  b. IQtree
  c. Visualize

8: Create table: 
  rows=recID
  column= len, dup/del?

9: discusssion: trends and patterns in trees.
